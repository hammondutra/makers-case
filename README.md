# ü§ñ Makers Tech Inventory ChatBot

A simple yet powerful chatbot built with Streamlit and Google's Gemini AI to answer customer questions about product inventory. The chatbot connects to a Supabase database to fetch real-time product information, providing an interactive conversational experience for users of the "Makers Tech" e-commerce store.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* A Google AI API Key. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
* A Supabase account and project. You can sign up at [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/hammondutra/makers-case.git](https://github.com/hammondutra/makers-case.git)
cd makers-case
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*(Note: You will need to create a `requirements.txt` file containing `streamlit`, `google-generativeai`, `supabase`, and `python-dotenv`)*

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project directory and add your API keys and Supabase credentials.

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL"
SUPABASE_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
```

### 4. Set Up Your Supabase Database

1.  In your Supabase project, create a new table named `Product Data`.
2.  Ensure the table has the following columns:
    * `name` (type: `text`)
    * `description` (type: `text`)
    * `price` (type: `numeric`)
    * `stock_count` (type: `int4` or `integer`)
3.  Add some product data to the table so the chatbot has information to share.

### 5. Run the Application

Once the setup is complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
*(Assuming your Python script is named `app.py`)*

Your browser should automatically open a new tab with the chatbot interface running.

## üîÆ Future Improvements

This project serves as a great proof-of-concept. Here are some planned enhancements:

* **Implement Vector Search**: Replace the current method of fetching all products with a more efficient **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline. This involves creating vector embeddings for product descriptions and performing a semantic search to retrieve only the most relevant products for the AI's context window.
* **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improve user-facing error messages for database connection issues or API failures.
* **Streaming Responses**: Modify the app to stream the AI's response token-by-token for a more responsive, real-time feel.
